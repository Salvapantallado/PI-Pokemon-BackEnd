# PI-Pokemon-BackEnd

BackEnd of my personal project for coding bootcamp SoyHenry. I had to use the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Redux
- Node.js

Also, all the pokemons' information had to come from <a href="https://pokeapi.com/">Poke Api</a> and store in database the necessary information (such as all the pokemon types and custom pokemons created by the user)

# How to start on local

1- Open your bash terminal

2- Write "npm install"

3- Wait for completion, then write "npm start"

This must be done for the <a href="https://github.com/Salvapantallado/PI-Pokemon-FrontEnd">FrontEnd</a> of this project as well

# Back End Known Issues

None at the moment of this version release

# What to do at this app

- You can search for pokemon along their types and find information about them!
- Filters by name and types are available (It was a requirement for approval not to use API endpoints).
- Sorting by weight and alphabetically (It was a requirement for approval not to use API endpoints).
